# US_2030Population README
## BACKGROUND/REASON
* I needed a data to argue the necessity/importance of my research thesis in osteoarthritis. 
* Osteoarthritis is common in elderly individuals, and US census data shows the percentage of people above 60 years old is increasing.

## DATA
### CLEANING
* Data was downloaded from US Census website, unfortunately in Excel highly formatted table.
* Data was made into .csv and prepared for R.

### OBJECTIVES
* As the purpose of this data is to show the aging US population, I grouped the data into 3 groups **(<18, 18-65, >65)**.
* And since details did not matter so much, I primarily showed the data in graphs. 

### DATA VIZ
* GGPLOT2 is used mostly. Theme, color, title were minimal. Graphs were exported in .eps file.
* Graphs were imported to Adobe Illustrator where fonts, colors, info were added.

## EXAMPLE OF WORK PROGRESS

## DISCLAIMER 
#### This is one of my first projects in making data visualisation, code choices and design decisions are purely my own preferences and based on my skill level at the time
#### Data was available publically. The extrapolation and percentage prediction are only informational. I did not checked how it was calculated.
#### Feel free to make the code better.
